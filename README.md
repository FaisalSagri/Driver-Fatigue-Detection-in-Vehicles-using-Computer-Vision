# Driver-Fatigue-Detection-in-Vehicles-using-Computer-Vision

A system which uses OpenCV and HAAR Cascade classifier in python to detect symptoms of fatigue early enough to avoid accidents.<br>

**Objectives:**<br>
•	To be able to detect face from a video feed or input image.<br>
•	To be able to detect the region of interest i.e, multiple facial recognition points.<br>
•	To accurately classify the state of the eye.<br>
•	To classify the various classes of driver's state based on the multiple parameters of facial features.<br>
•	To provide a warning alarm to the driver based on the classification classes.<br>


**Note:** The system used to run this program should have a minimum of 2GB RAM, a web camera and Python Version 3.6.<br>

**Required Python libraries:**<br>
•	Numpy<br>
•	Opencv<br>
•	CMake<br>
•	Dlib<br>
•	Imutils<br>
•	Pygame<br>

**Execution**<br>
Step 1: Run Terminal.<br>
Step 2: Execute ‘prequisite.py’ file provided to install the above libraries.<br>
Step 3: To run the project execute ‘drun.py’ file.<br>
Step 4: A dialog box will appear, click the run button to start driver fatigue detection system.<br>
Step 5: Perform eyes open or close, mouth open or close, to observe the system detect fatigue. <br>

**The results of test cases are included in the test/Test Plan.pdf **<br>
