# Driver-Fatigue-Detection-in-Vehicles-using-Computer-Vision
A system which uses OpenCV and HAAR Cascade classifier to detect symptoms of fatigue early enough to avoid accidents.
Note: The system used to run this program should have a minimum of 2GB RAM, a web camera and Python Version 3.6.
Required Python libraries:
•	Numpy
•	Opencv
•	CMake
•	Dlib
•	Imutils
•	Pygame

Execution
Step 1: Run Terminal. 
Step 2: Execute ‘prequisite.py’ file provided to install the above libraries.
Step 3: To run the project execute ‘drun.py’ file.
Step 4: A dialog box will appear, click the run button to start driver fatigue detection system.
Step 5: Perform eyes open or close, mouth open or close, to observe the system detect fatigue.
